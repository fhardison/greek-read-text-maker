# greek-reading-text-maker
A unfinished project to generate reader texts for Ancient/Koine Greek.

`process_file.py` converts a unmarked up text into xml that can be read by `make_html.py` and turned into a html page that can be read in a webbrowser. `make_html.py` uses an xslt transform to do this.
